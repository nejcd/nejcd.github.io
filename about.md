# About

Hello, world. 

I am a researcher and software engineer with a background in geodesy, remote sensing and geographical information systems. 

If you would like to discuss some interesting topics in person, you can find me at [GeoDev MeetUps](https://www.google.com/search?q=geodev&oq=geodev+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.1462j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) in Slovenia.
