I was thinking about setting up my page for some while and this day has finally come. Today I came across Jekyll and it is looking like perfect fit. As I am doing a lot of web development it i had a filling that is unappropriated too use web-page building platform. On the other hand it also seemed like overkill to do everything from scratch. So Jekyll is a perfect fit. No worries with DevOps, no Database, no complex setups. Just some markdown files and git push to Github and that it is.
