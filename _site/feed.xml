No worries with DevOps, no Database, no complex setups. Just some markdown files and git push and that is it. I have also found this amazing template &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack&quot;&gt;HydeJack&lt;/a&gt; which served as boiler plate for my page.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>&lt;Nejc&gt; &lt;Dougan&gt;</name><email>&lt;nejc.dougan@gmail.com&gt;</email></author><summary type="html">I was thinking about setting up my page for some while and this day has finally come.
